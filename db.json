The Acorn platform will be completely free to use in any country and for any legal purpose. With crowdfunding overtaking VC's as the most popular way to get funded, and with a growing appetite for entrepreneurship in developing economies, there is a huge and proven market.

        "Lucyd Lens will be the first convenient, comfortable and unnoticeable smartglasses thanks to our patents. We are designing an interactive AR display that uses your smartphone for processing power and data. The Lens will let you look up from your phone, and see all of your favorite apps in a large, smooth AR interface. With up to a 120° enhanced field of view that is over 3x larger than any available smartglasses, and a discreet body that looks like regular specs, Lucyd has the technology necessary to bring AR mainstream. We are launching the LCD token issuance to secure the funding for a prototype, and to build the Lucyd Lab app to drive native content creation. The first 500 pairs of Lucyd Lens are reserved for LCD holders only, giving token sale participants a chance to be among the first to own the glasses of the future."

ZF* makes advanced security techniques like formal verification natural to use. Contracts prove the resources they use before running, allowing for compiled contracts that run at native machine speed, and removing the need for a \"gas\" system. Zen Protocol's contracts can react to events on the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning that Bitcoiners can use Zen’s financial system without third parties or intermediaries.

LiveEdu is building the world's largest project-based learning (PBL) library on any topic starting with the seven topics programming, game development, data analytics, design, augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. The aim is to develop a decentralized online learning ecosystem that is not reliant on learning theory but practical useful career skills. The LiveEdu peer-to-peer marketplace will connect streamers (content creators) and viewers (learners) from all over the world. The idea being that streamers will create educational premium projects and are paid a monthly lifelong royalty fee if their projects are watched by viewers. The immediate business objective behind the LiveEdu crowdsale is to build 3,500 premium projects with 500 premium projects for each of the seven topics. LiveEdu also seeks to bring cryptocurrency to the masses by educating college students and professionals using real practical cryptocurrency tutorial projects covering cryptocurrency basics, blockchain mining, Bitcoin, Ethereum, security and ICOs. In this paper we will elucidate the benefits of project-based learning as well as the token mechanics for the EDU smart tokens and how we intend to fully integrate EDU into LiveEdu"

In other words, instead of stacking blocks to make a single full ledger, each set of changes to a contract is applied by the clients in a separate contract chain to the previous state, and the outcome is vectorized and hashed – only a signed signature of the state of each side-chain gets updated as the new status of the blockchain, discarding the old state and storing the new one. Still, each chain keeps it's own history, and any node with a copy of the transactions can attempt to replay them and verify that the outcome is the same, which ensures validity and fairness in a trusted environment."

However, the pseudo-anonymous nature of Ethereum blockchain network opens the possibility to avoid repayment of the loan since the lender might not have all the necessary details of the borrower to enforce the debt in the borrower's jurisdiction. Moreover, enforcement in a decentralized environment, where the parties can be from any part of the world, might not be efficient.

In fact, the inefficiencies are so pervasive, that for a veteran investor noticing atypical behavior of these markets may require just a glance at “the tape”. They manifest in a multitude of ways, including persistence of price disparities, speed of price adjustments, behavior of bid/ask spreads following shocks, as well as presence and behavior of automated trading systems, some of which have visibly unsophisticated trading rules. More efficient digital token markets are possible, but in order to achieve this goal-state new entrants into the space are required with an appropriate experience both in cut-throat traditional financial markets, as well as the fledgling digital tokens markets.
